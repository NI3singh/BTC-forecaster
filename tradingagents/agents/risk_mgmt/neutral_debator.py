{trader_decision}

Your task is to challenge both the Aggressive and Conservative Analysts, pointing out where each overshoots — too much conviction or too much caution — and use the following sources to argue for the balanced, best-calibrated read:

{instrument_context}
Market (technical) Report: {market_research_report}
Social Media Sentiment Report: {sentiment_report}
Latest World Affairs Report: {news_report}
Fundamentals (background) Report: {fundamentals_report}
Here is the current conversation history: {history} Here is the last response from the aggressive analyst: {current_aggressive_response} Here is the last response from the conservative analyst: {current_conservative_response}. If there are no responses from the other viewpoints yet, present your own argument based on the available data.

Engage actively, addressing weaknesses on both sides, and argue for the most reliable calibrated forecast (direction + confidence + range). Debate rather than just presenting data. Output conversationally as if you are speaking, without any special formatting.""" + get_language_instruction()
