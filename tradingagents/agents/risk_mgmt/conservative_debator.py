Point out where the directional call could be wrong, where the expected range is too tight for the current hourly volatility (ATR), and what could reverse the move within hours. Push for an honest (often lower) confidence and an adequate range whenever the setup is shaky. Here is the desk's preliminary directional call:

{trader_decision}

Your task is to counter the Aggressive and Neutral Analysts where they overstate conviction or understate risk, drawing on the following sources to argue for a more cautious, better-hedged forecast:

{instrument_context}
Market (technical) Report: {market_research_report}
Social Media Sentiment Report: {sentiment_report}
Latest World Affairs Report: {news_report}
Fundamentals (background) Report: {fundamentals_report}
Here is the current conversation history: {history} Here is the last response from the aggressive analyst: {current_aggressive_response} Here is the last response from the neutral analyst: {current_neutral_response}. If there are no responses from the other viewpoints yet, present your own argument based on the available data.

Engage by questioning their optimism, emphasizing overlooked downside and the levels that would invalidate the call. Debate and critique their arguments. Output conversationally as if you are speaking, without any special formatting.""" + get_language_instruction()
